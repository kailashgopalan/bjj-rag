What is the suggested approach in dealing with these?,"The suggested approach when dealing with complex requests from clients is to take time to understand the need, time box a certain amount of time, and recognize your own superpower within that small amount of time. It's also important to get really specific, engage, and clarify why the client is asking for what they're asking. Often, there's a very specific thing they're looking for, they just choose not to tell it right away.",Document 44: of feel like you know every every request that you know i i have to do exactly what they asked me to do and if it's like a 20 week engagement you know that that occupies all my time well i guess that's what i guess that's my life now basically and to say well you could probably do a lot for them if you took time to understand the need and time box a certain amount of time and you know recognize your own superpower within that small amount of time much more than you might think you can do thank you what do you think Mimi? August so elegantly wrapped up some of them what we experienced in a much kinder way which is sometimes you get these requests from restaurants like what are you asking you like you want us to boil the ocean right so getting really specific and engaging and and clarifying well why right usually most of time there's a very specific thing they're looking for they just choose not to tell us right until a couple of cycles but oftentimes it is a very reasonable request if,"[{'role': 'user', 'content': 'There are complex requests coming from our clients.'}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 44, 'topic': 'Competitive Intelligence in Sales'}","The suggested approach in dealing with these requests is to prioritize them based on revenue impact and deal value, and to tailor the responses to specific scenarios or competitor traps.",False,"The agent's answer does not match the ground truth. The ground truth suggests understanding the need, time boxing, recognizing one's own superpower, getting specific, engaging, and clarifying why the client is asking for what they're asking.

Could you tell me one of the criteria used?,One of the criteria used to evaluate ad hoc project requests is alignment with strategic objectives.,Document 55: those projects and alignment with strategic objectives as well you know so taking it back to to mean these really excellent point about prioritization one of the hurdles or one of the you know linds is through which we look at ad hoc project requests is alignment with strategic objectives as well and so we are evaluating ourselves based on how well we're supporting each of those and i would add you know i i am for my team love this but i kind of want to track all of the requests that we get our way even the ones that we decline right because that proves again the value of the of the team and um i'm sure everyone feels the pain at a loose yeah teams are very very small and so um i can actually then you know quarterly or annual summary um show my leadership the projects or the requests that we decline due to lack of staff right it usually isn't enough to get things over the line but it's just kind of reinforces a the value that your team provides because you're getting all these,"[{'role': 'user', 'content': ""I'm interested in the evaluation process of ad hoc project requests.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 55, 'topic': 'Competitive Intelligence in Sales'}","Employees and coworkers were considered extremely valuable as a source of competitive intelligence, with 63% of CI leaders stating it was extremely valuable.",False,"The agent's answer does not match the ground truth.

How often do they occur?,The readouts for the board and executive team are done quarterly.,Document 58: looped in on kind of the regular cadences the the the team meetings the regular like projects that we're a part of um we have take out campaigns for example where we go to market motions so our team is involved in that and so we just kind of plug in naturally um and then you know as we discuss with with august like the sales side is the kind of a constant update of like here's a new piece of a battle card here's a new insights here's whatever it is that is just more real time because we want to reinforce with those sellers that um someone a group is actively looking after that content and making sure that it's up to date and it's very similar situation on our side as well um so you know quarterly readouts for our board and our executive team quarterly readouts for the whole sales organization and then supplemented of course with like I said our monthly readout to the whole you know to the to the whole business and it's and that's geared more towards the you know the you know the the,"[{'role': 'user', 'content': ""I'm interested in the frequency of readouts for the board and executive team.""}, {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'How can I help you with that?'}]","{'question_type': 'conversational', 'seed_document_id': 58, 'topic': 'Competitive Intelligence in Sales'}","The meetings occur on a monthly basis, with some occurring weekly or ad hoc based on requirements or issues.",False,"The agent's answer does not match the ground truth.

What is one of those things according to her?,One of the most important things for people running competitive intelligence is to find ways to influence without necessarily having authority.,Document 11: hi but Carolyn runs market and competitive intelligence at affinity and she almost a year ago at one point we were talking about win loss and she said that one of the most important things for folks who are running CI is to find ways to influence without necessarily having authority right and I think to your point Mimi reaching out to those sellers who are using the content and finding ways to to maybe work with them that's one way in the absence of authority you can maybe hopefully start to influence the folks aren't using CI. That's so funny just just the chime in you know we ran a workshop with an analyst firm and when they found out that I was a sponsor in CI she said oh I used to do CI they have no power no influence and no money it's a really hard job and I was like thank you thank you for understanding so absolutely where you can find influence where you can find champions you gotta find you gotta do it.
