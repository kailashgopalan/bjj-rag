It involves showing your stakeholders that your team is responsible for enabling materials for competitive intelligence like battle cards. When you provide the assets that your stakeholders need, it creates goodwill and a relationship where valuable insights and information flow back to you. It's a long-term relationship play that can significantly aid in understanding competitors.","reference_context":"Document 32: and create those relationships so I think one of the first pieces when we first discuss this was I think it would be difficult to expect all of the insights and all the information's without putting in that hard work right of showing your stakeholders that your team is responsible for enabling materials for competitive intelligence for battle cards or what have you right I think when you show up with the assets that your stakeholders need then again that creates that goodwill that relationship where it comes back to you I think expecting that from the beginning it's just going to be harder much much harder I agree with the data I agree with probably everyone in this in a space getting information from the field is be most helpful ensuring up what you know about your competitors but that is a long-term relationship play I think more than anything else how about you August yeah I absolutely agree with with Mimi's comments that it is a long-term relationship play and you do have to","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"Let's talk about the importance of building relationships with stakeholders in the context of competitive intelligence."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":32,"topic":"Competitive Intelligence in Sales"}}

They did not end up getting the volume that they needed to adequately get insights.","reference_context":"Document 18: customers and so my team has kind of backed up a little bit and started internally so win loss is not just talking to turned customers it's also you can have interviews and and have conversations with the reps that lost those customers skip those learnings as a starting point and so we found success in being able to grab those stories put that in our battle cards so that others can learn from those lessons and move from there but that's really the state of win loss in terms of a formal program here at Akamai we also use our Salesforce data for win loss analysis which is another component of it as well. That's a thank you how about you August your your yours would win loss and maybe a lesson or two learned along the way. Yeah so so win loss the return on the investment is really significant and I think you know Mimi's example for the program at HubSpot really bears that out and I would absolutely validate that based on win loss that I've done in my time at I British Telecom and Verizon\n\nDocument 17: bit about your your experiences with win loss analysis and it may be a less energy that you you've learned along the way. Sure win losses this is very very tricky I'd be interested to hear the experiences of folks listening in so previously I headed up competitive intelligence at HubSpot and we ran win loss with a third party vendor they would we would you know source loss customers and they would reach out interview summarize all of that good stuff it was really really effective it was reported out to leadership really successful program it was something that we wanted to do an Akamai same vendor same process really hard connect rates we we never ended up getting the volume that we needed to adequately get insights and so you know that was definitely a learning that maybe especially when as I was tasked on building a competitive program which included win loss that we didn't have to go full throttle and go for the like the nirvana state which is talking to lost customers and so my","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"We're discussing the win loss analysis program at Akamai, which didn't meet expectations."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":18,"topic":"Customer Win-Loss Analysis"}}

August so elegantly wrapped up some of them what we experienced in a much kinder way which is sometimes you get these requests from restaurants like what are you asking you like you want us to boil the ocean right so getting really specific and engaging and and clarifying well why right usually most of time there's a very specific thing they're looking for they just choose not to tell us right until a couple of cycles but oftentimes it is a very reasonable request if","conversation_history":[{"role":"user","content":"There are complex requests coming from our clients."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How can I help you with that?"}],"metadata":{"question_type":"conversational","seed_document_id":44,"topic":"Competitive Intelligence in Sales"}}
