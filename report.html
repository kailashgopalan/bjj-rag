This repetition helps to overcome challenges related to these factors and ensure that the sales team is well-equipped to handle various situations, such as handling traps set by competitors.","When a third party is involved in conducting customer interviews, the accept rate tends to be higher because customers feel more comfortable being truly honest in a psychologically safe space. They know that the third party is not biased and is not trying to sell them anything, so they can provide feedback openly without any fear of repercussions.","The course of action suggested for stakeholders struggling to comprehend the significance of Competitive Intelligence (CI) would be to make themselves more visible and overcommunicate. This can help in improving visibility and communication regarding the value of CI.","When an exceptionally valuable piece of information or insight is received from the business, specific actions taken include sharing it with relevant individuals or teams, reinforcing the behavior of sharing important insights, and hosting sessions to engage individuals on specific sections of the information or data.","Mimi and August are the individuals participating in the session. Mimi and August run competitive intelligence at Akamai and Deltech respectively. Sheila Leihar is the senior director of content at Crayon and will be monitoring the Q&amp;A section. Connor is on the content team at Crayon.","Some effective tactics to motivate and incentivize customers, particularly those in the small and medium business sector, to actively participate in win loss interviews include offering incentives such as charitable donations, gift cards, or other forms of compensation. Additionally, partnering with a partner who can offer incentives or providing an incentive for participating in the win loss interview can help increase customer responsiveness.","I don&#x27;t know.","The two roles that CI professionals might need to adopt are being more strategic in their approach and focusing on measuring the impact of competitive intelligence.","Some of the objectives they are striving to achieve include providing competitive updates, doing deep dives on particular topics like competitors or products, offering competitive intelligence upskilling, winning more competitive deals, expanding the team&#x27;s influence, and moving towards more strategic work.","The organization prioritizes requests for competitive intelligence based on the deal value associated with the request. The higher the deal value, the more likely they are to make time to address the request because it will have a more significant impact on the business. They also organize their team based on revenue impact, focusing on the top competitors first.","Based on the context provided, the communication channels utilized to share information, particularly in relation to competitive intelligence, include direct emails, distra list, crayon, and field intel submission methods preferred by sales reps and AES.","The executive team receives updates on the competitive posture for the two major business lines two times a quarter.","One key factor in earning stakeholders&#x27; trust within competitive intelligence teams could be demonstrating the ability to address their needs efficiently and effectively, showing that the team has the skills, expertise, and knowledge to deliver valuable insights in a timely manner.","Having a clear goal for a Competitive Intelligence initiative helps in establishing initial key performance indicators (KPIs) and filtering ad hoc requests. It also ensures that the team is focused on the purpose of why they are conducting competitive intelligence work, which ultimately helps in gaining executive sponsorship and regular engagement with stakeholders.","Carolyn suggested finding ways to influence without necessarily having authority and to recognize and highlight valuable insights in a corporate culture.","Third-party research contributes to the organization&#x27;s efforts by providing independent verification of the company&#x27;s positioning and capabilities, which can be used to reinforce the sales team&#x27;s messaging and establish credibility with product and leadership teams. This helps in satisfying sales teams by providing proof points for the information they need to sell effectively, as well as in building strong relationships with product and leadership teams by bringing in valuable market perspective and larger trends that the organization might miss internally.","The team presents their findings to the board and sales organization during monthly meetings.","The first thing you need to ensure before starting competitive intelligence work is to understand the needs of your stakeholders and identify the hidden needs that may not be explicitly stated.","In this context, the role of competitive intelligence (CI) professionals is to gather and analyze information about competitors in the market to provide insights and strategic guidance for marketing and sales teams. They aim to help companies understand how their competitors operate, what strategies they are implementing, and how they can differentiate themselves to gain a competitive advantage.","Based on the context provided, Akamai currently uses Salesforce data for win loss analysis as one of the methods.","The updates on the competitive posture for the two major business lines are provided to the executive team twice a quarter. These updates focus on the competitive posture of the business lines and are tailored to what the executive team cares about, rather than general metrics or program success.","Some incentives that you can offer to small and medium business customers to encourage them to participate in win loss interviews include offering a charitable donation on their behalf, providing gift cards for their participation, or offering some form of compensation for their time and feedback. These incentives can help show customers that you value their input and are committed to improving your services based on their feedback.","The two main pieces of advice for soliciting competitive intelligence are:\\n\\n1. Understand the hidden needs of stakeholders and find ways to address them.\\n2. Remember that you have valuable skills and expertise to address ad hoc requests efficiently and effectively.","One of the criteria for evaluating ad hoc project requests is alignment with strategic objectives.","The research on customer perception of differentiation was deemed effective because it revealed that competitors were using the exact same differentiation as the company and that customers felt the same way about both companies. This highlighted a lack of true differentiation and raised concerns about the company&#x27;s competitive advantage.","You need to think like a marketer in order to ensure that your strategy aligns with your end goal, as mentioned in the discussion about competitive intelligence.","One of the keys to earning the trust of your stakeholders, especially when it comes to supporting them on an ad hoc basis without compromising long-term activities in the competitive intelligence portfolio, is finding ways to provide ad hoc support and showing that your team is responsible for enabling materials for competitive intelligence. Building long-term relationships and creating goodwill by providing the assets that your stakeholders need is crucial in earning their trust.","The most valuable source of competitive intelligence according to CI leaders is employees and coworkers, as 63% of CI leaders find the intel they get from them extremely valuable. The potential risk of relying purely on quantitative CRM data is that it may lead to the law of small numbers working against you, resulting in skewed insights.","The purpose of the state of competitive intelligence report is to be the source of truth for anyone who wants to know why and how companies invest in competitive intelligence programs. It is published annually, with a new edition released every year since 2018.","One of the most important things for folks running Competitive Intelligence (CI) is to constantly refresh their understanding of what CI can deliver in different scenarios. The challenge with this is that sometimes stakeholders may not even realize the value that CI can provide in a particular situation, so they may not ask for it.","One strategy to demonstrate the value of competitive intelligence when it&#x27;s a new function is to lean into other sources initially to show value. One strategy to encourage stakeholders to share insights is to show up with assets that demonstrate the value back to them or the business.","Overcommunication in competitive intelligence entails consistently sharing information and updates with stakeholders, even if it may feel like repeating oneself. Specifically, being specific in the communication by tailoring the information to the unique situations and needs of the audience adds value by demonstrating the relevance and importance of competitive intelligence insights in their specific context.","The percentage increase of CI leaders who said yes since 2018 is 125%. One of the KPIs for the CI program at Alka Mai is the number of battle cards.","Small and medium business customers are more likely to respond to an inquiry, and incentives such as charitable donations, gift cards, or some form of compensation are often offered to encourage participation in win loss interviews.","Field intel can be shared through various channels such as direct email, the distra list, crayon, and other avenues. The key to getting intel from sales reps and AES is to make it easy for them to submit field intel in the way that is most convenient for them, whether it be through email, teams, Slack, or any other tool they prefer.","The sales team meets monthly to discuss competitive intelligence updates. The topics usually covered in these meetings include important competitive updates from the last month, deep dives on specific topics such as competitors or products, and competitive intelligence upskilling.","The benefit of a third party conducting win-loss interviews is that it increases the accept rate as customers feel more comfortable being truly honest in a psychologically safe space. It is important to include \\"no decisions\\" in these interviews because it provides valuable insights into why potential customers chose not to move forward with a purchase, helping the business understand areas for improvement.","One recommended action to improve this is to create a virtuous cycle by reaching out to certain reps for feedback and reviews on the product.","Sheila Leihar is in charge of monitoring it.","The purpose of the conversation seems to be discussing the importance of setting goals and objectives for a competitive intelligence program in order to avoid constantly reacting to ad hoc requests and instead have a clear focus on strategic priorities.","The advice given to them is to be open to receiving field intelligence from any channels, reinforce all avenues for field information sharing, accept field intelligence regardless of where it comes from, make it easy for sales reps and account executives to submit field intelligence, give kudos, and provide specific information that stakeholders are looking for. Additionally, the advice includes overcommunicating, making oneself more visible, and focusing on sellers in particular.","I don&#x27;t know.","I don&#x27;t know.","The suggested approach in dealing with these requests is to prioritize them based on revenue impact and deal value, and to tailor the responses to specific scenarios or competitor traps.","Employees and coworkers were considered extremely valuable as a source of competitive intelligence, with 63% of CI leaders stating it was extremely valuable.","The meetings occur on a monthly basis, with some occurring weekly or ad hoc based on requirements or issues.","One of those things according to her is showing up and overcommunicating to make themselves more visible and help stakeholders understand the value of CI."]],["reference_answer",["One of the criteria used to evaluate ad hoc project requests is alignment with strategic objectives.","You can gather this information through different ways. You can use the &#x27;add new intel&#x27; button on crayon, email, teams, or Slack. The choice of tool depends on what the individual feels most comfortable with.","The advice given is to start simple with the KPIs. One example of a KPI mentioned is the number of battle cards.","The recommended steps are to make themselves more visible and overcommunicate. It&#x27;s also suggested to show up and provide specific information that stakeholders are looking for.","Reps are almost 50% more likely to win an opportunity when they name a competitor or an incumbent.","The practice is viewed as powerful and beneficial. It helps people understand the &#x27;art of the possible&#x27; with competitive intelligence, as they learn what actually matters and can gauge whether something is worth sending.","One way is by measuring the number of pursuits or projects, the person hours associated with those projects, and the positive results as a consequence of those projects.","The benefits of conducting internal win loss analysis include gaining valuable insights that could help the business improve. This can be achieved by analyzing Salesforce data, conducting internal interviews, and getting the perspectives of different stakeholders such as the account executive, bid manager, and solutions engineer. However, the cost associated with this approach is the significant investment of time, which stakeholders need to be aware of as there is an opportunity cost involved.","The Crown state of competitive intelligence was originally launched in 2018.","The goal of the State of Competitive Intelligence report is to be the source of truth for anyone who wants to know why and how companies invest in competitive intelligence programs.","Setting goals for a CI program is important because it provides a purpose or objective. Without a goal, it&#x27;s easy to find yourself constantly fighting fires and responding to ad hoc requests. Having a goal can help monitor what&#x27;s coming in and determine if executing on a particular task will contribute to achieving the set objective.","The Crown state of competitive intelligence was originally launched in 2018.","The behavior that translates into more wins is when reps name a competitor or an incumbent. It&#x27;s known that reps are almost 50% more likely to win an opportunity when they do this.","The purpose of reinforcing knowledge and awareness of resources in a sales force is to handle traps that a leading competitor may set and to continually reinforce that knowledge and awareness. This is necessary due to turnover in a sales force, different learning methods, and the fallibility of human memory. Repetition helps reinforce this knowledge.","Having a third party conduct the interviews tends to increase the accept rate because customers know that they can be truly honest and that the third party is not trying to sell them anything, it is truly to learn.","The recommended approach for stakeholders to understand the value of Competitive Intelligence (CI) is to make themselves more visible and overcommunicate.","When a particularly valuable insight comes in from the business, there is a little award ceremony for the person who shared that insight. This is done to recognize good contributions and to encourage others to bring valuable insights.","The people participating in the session are Connor from the content team at Crayon, Mimi and August who run competitive intelligence at Akamai and Deltech respectively, and Sheila Leihar, the senior director of content at Crayon.","Small and medium business customers are much more likely to respond to an inquiry. Offering incentives such as a charitable donation or a gift card can also encourage participation in the win loss interview.","see you next time thanks everyone thanks so much everyone","CI professionals sometimes need to act like marketers and sellers.","The team&#x27;s objectives include winning more competitive deals, expanding the influence of the team, and moving out of pure sales enablements to some more of that strategic work.","The organization prioritizes requests through a tiering system. They encourage people to fill a form with questions they typically ask to get detailed information in advance. They also tie it to deal value, the higher the deal value the more likely they will address it. They have organized their team based on top competitors, again based on revenue impact. If a request is for a competitor that&#x27;s lower down, they might reject the request.","The team uses WebEx for ad hoc communications and has a channel dedicated to competitive where a lot of information is pushed out.","The executive team receives updates on the competitive posture for the two major business lines twice a quarter.","One of the keys to earning the trust of your stakeholders is finding ways to support them on an ad hoc basis.","Having a goal for your CI (Competitive Intelligence) program is important because it can help monitor what&#x27;s coming in and determine if executing on a particular task or request will be beneficial. Without a purpose or goal, it&#x27;s easy to find oneself constantly fighting fires and responding to ad hoc requests.","Carolyn advised that one of the most important things for people running competitive intelligence is to find ways to influence without necessarily having authority.","Third-party research, such as that provided by Four Five One, is used to reinforce the organization&#x27;s positioning. It&#x27;s viewed as reputable and independent verification of the organization&#x27;s standing. It&#x27;s also used to bring more market perspective into the business to avoid being too insular and missing larger trends.","The team provides quarterly readouts to the board and the sales organization.","Before starting competitive intelligence work, make sure that you know why you&#x27;re doing competitive intelligence. This will help you establish the initial key performance indicators and start filtering ad hoc requests.","Competitive intelligence (CI) professionals need to act like marketers, over communicating and showcasing the value of CI. They also need to think like sellers, doing discovery to uncover the underlying needs of the buyer.","Akamai uses Salesforce data for win loss analysis and also conducts interviews with the reps that lost customers. However, they had difficulty getting adequate volume of insights when they tried to use a third-party vendor for win loss analysis, as they did at HubSpot.","For the executive team, updates on the company&#x27;s competitive posture for its two major business lines are provided twice a quarter. These updates focus on what the executives care about, rather than on program details or metrics.","Incentives that can be offered to small and medium business customers to participate in win loss interviews include charitable donations or gift cards.","The first piece of advice is to understand the real needs of the stakeholders, as the original statement often hides the need. The second piece of advice is to always remember that with your skills, expertise, and knowledge, you can deliver much more than the stakeholder could get on their own in a short amount of time.","One of the criteria for evaluating ad hoc project requests is alignment with strategic objectives.","The research was considered effective because it revealed that the company&#x27;s differentiation was not unique. Both their customers and their competitors&#x27; customers felt the same way about their respective companies. This insight was important for the company&#x27;s leaders as they were trying to evolve the business.","CI folks need to act like marketers in over communicating and getting out the value of CI. They also need to think like sellers, doing discovery especially for private marketers.","One of the keys to earning the trust of your stakeholders is finding ways to support them on an ad hoc basis.","The most valuable source of competitive intelligence according to CI leaders is the intel they get from their employees and coworkers, and if you rely purely on quantitative CRM data, you might take yourself down a path where the law of small numbers is working against you.","The goal of the state of competitive intelligence report is to be the source of truth for anyone out there who wants to know why and how companies invest in competitive intelligence programs, and it is published once a year.","One of the most important things for folks who are running CI is to find ways to influence without necessarily having authority, and the challenge is that they often have no power, no influence, and no money.","Initially, the value of competitive intelligence can be demonstrated by leaning into other sources of insights. A strategy to encourage stakeholders to share insights is to show up with assets that demonstrate the value of their insights for the business. Over time, as stakeholders see the value it brings to the business, they are more likely to invest their time in providing insights.","Overcommunication in competitive intelligence involves repeating the same information multiple times to ensure its understanding, even if it feels like the same thing is being said repeatedly. Specificity, on the other hand, can make a competitive asset more relevant and practical in a specific situation, helping to connect the dots between a general competitive intelligence asset and a specific situation.","The percentage increase of CI leaders who said yes since 2018 is 125% and one of the KPIs for the CI program at Alka Mai is the number of battle cards.","Small and medium business customers are much more likely to respond to an inquiry and incentives for participating in the win loss interview might include a charitable donation or a gift card.","Field intel can be shared through various channels such as direct email, the distra list, or platforms like Crayon.

Including no decisions in these interviews is important as it can provide additional insights and perspectives that may not be captured when only focusing on wins and losses.","One action is to look at your sales teams&#x27; calendars and see where they have standing meetings. Advocate for yourself to get on the agenda periodically as that will help drive the adoption of the material you are creating.","Sheila Leihar, the senior director of content at Crayon, is monitoring the Q&amp;A section in the State of competitive intelligence in 2023 session.","The goal of the &#x27;State of Competitive Intelligence&#x27; report is to be the source of truth for anyone who wants to know why and how companies invest in competitive intelligence programs.","The advice given is to start simple with the KPIs. Some can be hard numbers while others can be more aspirational. An example of a hard number KPI is the number of battle cards.","Building relationships with stakeholders in competitive intelligence is crucial. It involves showing your stakeholders that your team is responsible for enabling materials for competitive intelligence like battle cards. When you provide the assets that your stakeholders need, it creates goodwill and a relationship where valuable insights and information flow back to you. It&#x27;s a long-term relationship play that can significantly aid in understanding competitors.","The win loss analysis program at Akamai was not as successful as expected because they had a hard time connecting with customers. They did not end up getting the volume that they needed to adequately get insights.","The suggested approach when dealing with complex requests from clients is to take time to understand the need, time box a certain amount of time, and recognize your own superpower within that small amount of time. It&#x27;s also important to get really specific, engage, and clarify why the client is asking for what they&#x27;re asking.

I&#x27;m very happy today to be joined by Mimi in August who run competitive intelligence at Akamai and Deltech respectively. I am also joined today by Sheila Leihar who is our senior director of content here at crayon. She will be monitoring the the Q&amp;A section. So periodically throughout today&#x27;s session, I will I&#x27;ll ...","before I get to it today&#x27;s agenda, Mimi and August, thank you so much for being here. Thank you for having us. Thanks Connor. So like I said, super simple agenda for our time together today. In not even two minutes, I will just quickly give some background on the state of competitive intelligence in case anyone is not familiar with what it is. And then for the majority of our time together today, we will be walking through the top five insights from the latest edition of the state of CI at the 2...","in in 2018. So if you&#x27;re familiar with, you know, HubSpot state of marketing or or Salesforce and state of sales that crown has the state of competitive intelligence, of course. So we published a new edition every year since 2018. The latest edition of the 2023 edition is number six. And it&#x27;s based on a survey of more than more than 900 competitive intelligence leaders like me and August, as well as stakeholders, folks like sales reps and CSMs and other folks who use competitive intelligence thr...","be spent walking through the top five insights. But first, we do have a poll. Caitlin is going to set that live. So what is the biggest roadblock keeping you from driving adoption of competitive intelligence or or usage? And you can see you have three options there and another. So if you can all just take a few seconds to answer that poll question. Cool. So it looks like with almost half of the poll respondents, the biggest roadblock is stakeholders don&#x27;t fully understand the value of CI. And th...","who are on this call, they made it really clear to the folks that they work with, right, that they&#x27;re available and people can find them. I think it&#x27;s the value piece is longer term and a little bit more difficult. So definitely not surprised by it. Something that constantly needs to be refreshed as well with new stakeholders, new understandings of what competitive intelligence is able to do into scenarios that they&#x27;re facing. And sometimes a stakeholder may not even realize there&#x27;s value that c...","competitive. And as you can see, for the average B2B software company based on those responses, two thirds, 66% of deals are competitive. So our discussion questions for this first insight for Mimi and August is, how do you get sales reps to adopt the competitive insights that you share with Mimi? Would you mind sort of kicking us off on this topic? Yeah, absolutely. And I think, you know, August and I had a very similar reaction, which is road showing C.I. and the things that are available to n...","it&#x27;s awareness of a particular resource that they can apply or specific insights, for example, let&#x27;s say how to handle traps that a leading competitor may set for you that getting out in front of a sales force again and again continually reinforces that knowledge and that awareness of those resources and between turnover in a sales force and let&#x27;s say maybe some people learn things different ways and just the the fallibility of human memory and just to reinforce, reinforce, and repetition are yo...","they have a need or requirement of particular stage in the sales cycle or with a particular competitor that you know maybe is trap, you know, setting a trap that should not be as effective as it&#x27;s proving to be and so we spend some time on those specific yeah, reinforcing those specific activities. Is that something that you will do as well? Mimi sometimes is go one level deeper beyond just here&#x27;s how to you know, sell against this competitor and even go here&#x27;s how to sell against this competito...","specific thing that they&#x27;re looking for. I think a little bit of that white blob service, right? To to a rep and just kind of handing them exactly what they&#x27;re looking for, it helps, right? Bring that good will that you need, right? In terms of what CI can offer and the usability of the product, that&#x27;s important. Yeah, just so for the folks out there who who more for everyone, but specifically those folks those the half or so who said that they&#x27;re their biggest row block is is getting their stak...","Do you have any thoughts there August? I like the overcommunication framing because for you it will feel like you are overcommunicating oh my gosh, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying the same thing to them the third time this month, that sort of thing. But you&#x27;re you&#x27;re also over indexing on how much people have listened to you the first two times seeing you represented something. And I like me these point two about the specificity, you know, that every opportunity is different and being able to make fo...","know showing the value of CI to their stakeholders. I think you might want to kind of create that virtuous cycle which is if you&#x27;ve had enough time momentum and usage of certain reps maybe not the entire chart field reach out to those reps and kind of do a little bit of a review or get feedback right. Here&#x27;s a battle card these are the components is it actually helpful is it useful?

Well for us it&#x27;s it&#x27;s a it&#x27;s a combination of set and let&#x27;s say ad hoc opportunities to get in front of our sellers so we do have a monthly engagement with everyone in the organization and it&#x27;s primarily attended by sales and that&#x27;s our opportun...","own competitive intelligence and amongst the many things we do now that you know this coming Thursday our webinars actually a reintroduction to crayon as a competitive intelligence resource for everybody inside of our business. So that&#x27;s that&#x27;s a regular thing we do on a monthly basis we have a regular cadence with specific sales teams and product teams inside of the business as well some of those are are frequently as every week most of them are monthly also and then we do occasionally when som...","there&#x27;s so many meetings right for that those teams have to attend what we did especially early on as we were introducing Cran was you know get on the agenda of the chief sales officers QBRs and all hands meetings then you know we would kind of draft off of that and attend the regional GLEads monthly as well and now that we&#x27;re a little bit more established it&#x27;s more on an ad hoc basis where we get in front of teams based on requirements or issues that they&#x27;re seeing their pipeline that they woul...","resource for us to keep people in the know.

Sure win losses this is very very tricky I&#x27;d be interested to hear the experiences of folks listening in so previously I headed up competitive intelligence at HubSpot and we ran win loss with a third party vendor they would we would you know source loss customers and they would reach out interview summarize all of that good stuff it was really really effective it was reported...","customers and so my team has kind of backed up a little bit and started internally so win loss is not just talking to turned customers it&#x27;s also you can have interviews and and have conversations with the reps that lost those customers skip those learnings as a starting point and so we found success in being able to grab those stories put that in our battle cards so that others can learn from those lessons and move from there but that&#x27;s really the state of win loss in terms of a formal program h...","Telecom and Verizon and and that we&#x27;re doing here at Delpekt as well the investment both on time or money can be really quite significant so it&#x27;s it&#x27;s really quite telling that the return the insight that comes from that investment is so you know it is so valuable but to say that sometimes it takes a while to convince the business to let you pursue that Nirvana state has made me describe it and that&#x27;s really a third party so truly truly objective and some of it preferably somebody who specialize...","Salesforce data and conducting analysis and and doing internal interviews are really valuable way to get started on win loss and kind of get your stakeholders a little bit hungry for the insights that could be available if they make that investment now the investment of your time is still going to be really significant so stakeholders need to understand there is an opportunity cost associated with us taking this internal approach to win loss but if for example in an enterprise oriented organizat...","so what I&#x27;m hearing for folks here who who are dying to get started with will loss they they know the value and they just don&#x27;t know where to start it sounds like first of all it&#x27;s maybe adjust your expectations like this is this is a marathon on sprint and also and you know you&#x27;re gonna you know maybe some of you have have executive leaders who who love win loss but let&#x27;s assume that&#x27;s not the case you&#x27;re gonna have to build a business case for this and it sounds like one of the best things to ...","that are sometimes skeptical of of win loss or maybe a little wary of it and I&#x27;m thinking here particularly about sellers that feel like hey is this is this an exercise to kind of like rat me out for them to recognize actually this is a systematic analysis of the organization&#x27;s effectiveness of selling and winning in the market definitely sure it looks like we&#x27;ve had some questions come out any questions on win loss that we can throw to August and Mimi here the first question actually there&#x27;s tw...","just like Mimi&#x27;s experience particularly on the enterprise side getting customers to respond has been more difficult I will say at least in my experience small and medium business customers are much more likely to respond to an inquiry much more likely to be responsive to if you or your partner that that may you know if you&#x27;ve got a partner that that&#x27;s doing the interviews is offering in any sort of incentive with that and sometimes that comes into the the cost of a you know of that holy grail w...","we would like to understand more about that um and in my experience and Mimi had a love in your perspective on this you know customers particularly if they&#x27;re maybe a little bit not thrilled with you would appreciate the opportunity in a safe place in a psychologically safe space to tell you why they&#x27;re not happy with you now absolutely and that&#x27;s why having a third party conduct the interviews also tends to increase the accept rate because they know that they can be truly honest and that that t...","is important it doesn&#x27;t have to be a $300 500 incentive a small amount I think is very much something you can swing and it does make a difference in terms of again increasing the acceptance rate having an executive sponsor also is important to eat if it only in name both at HubSpot and at Akamai even though the Akamai experience wasn&#x27;t quite as successful we had the emails that you know that we sent out to the turned customers all came from our EVPs or the CEO where it was a message directly fro...","more about how to maximize the return on investment for this kind of work so I&#x27;ll pass that to me because I know you had mentioned the CRM data but yeah how to just get I guess the most out of this type of work I think it&#x27;s the most effective when it&#x27;s tied to a business objective right if there&#x27;s a major launch of something and you need that information that&#x27;s where you should be focusing on instead of like let&#x27;s just anyone anyone on anything let&#x27;s ask them the questions so even with that appr...","model where we had customers of ours reinforced whether or not our differentiation was all that different and we also interviewed users of our competition and asking the same questions and the data that came back which we presented to leadership was our competitors are using exact same differentiation as we do and their customers feel exactly the same way about them that ours you about us that&#x27;s a problem right that&#x27;s that that if everyone feels the same way it&#x27;s not differentiation so I know th...","know at me at least point about you know aligning with other things that you&#x27;re you know seeing in the business to the extent that you can align your win-loss with any strategic objectives that the business may have you know if there are strategic priorities or initiatives that are clearly articulated by your leader 15 the opportunity to shed insight into those through win-loss is is a great way to demonstrate the value and get that return on the investment I have one more question in this secti...","mix qualitative and quantitative and that you know can always be a little bit fraught sometimes you&#x27;ve got stakeholders that really prefer one versus the other you know very finance minded people really like the quantitative people from you know marketing and other functions tend to like much more the qualitative but I find by mixing the two you can really scratch everyone&#x27;s itch in terms of the insights that you&#x27;re bringing back and you know and some insights are you know very qualitative in in...","in the in the CRM data more so if you go purely quantitative you might take yourself down a path where the law of small numbers is working against you and in qualitative insights are a great way to to make sure you don&#x27;t over index on that I think we&#x27;re good for questions for now Connor cool thank you Sheila we will move on to our third insight from the state of CI this is a lot so I&#x27;ll explain here so in our survey of CI leaders we we give him this list of whatever it is 10 or 11 sources of com...","they get from their co-workers is extremely valuable so I think it&#x27;s safe to assume that almost everyone on this call wants to get more intel from their from their co-workers especially those in the field and in sales and customer success so we&#x27;ll start with you here Mimi we would let it know if you have any tips for the folks in the audience about sourcing this this intelligence from the field from the front line yeah and my tip ties into kind of the first talking point that we had which is kin...","and create those relationships so I think one of the first pieces when we first discuss this was I think it would be difficult to expect all of the insights and all the information&#x27;s without putting in that hard work right of showing your stakeholders that your team is responsible for enabling materials for competitive intelligence for battle cards or what have you right I think when you show up with the assets that your stakeholders need then again that creates that goodwill that relationship w...","and you do have to demonstrate that value there can be a little bit of that chicken and egg if the competitive intelligence function is new that you know how do you demonstrate the value of your insights if if one of the most if not the most important source of your insights is not providing you those insights yet yeah so so that&#x27;s you know maybe something where you lean into the other sources where you can demonstrate some of that value initially and then you know to to Mimi&#x27;s point about being...","a little bit as well so you know particularly the you know the teams that are bringing really valuable or important insights to the extent that they&#x27;re comfortable in your corporate culture is comfortable having that highlighted you know find a venue where where you can do that so another thing we do I mentioned that monthly call that my team and I host when a particular valuable insight comes in from the business we have a little award ceremony for for the person who shared that insight and and...","by all this amazing intelligence from the field so make that make that change in your expectations and like with win loss where you&#x27;re just do what you can at first build the case build that trust and the other thing I&#x27;m hearing is and you know maybe you call this out this this insight ties in nicely with with the first one that we discussed if there&#x27;s one action I&#x27;m so far for everyone you know on this call it&#x27;s you know look at your sales teams calendars see where they have those standing meet...","help you with those internal win loss interviews right so get in front of your sales team you know advocate for yourself because no one else is going to at least at first right Sheila do we have any questions on field intel for you on we have one question that I think is helpful from Chris just the best way to get this information from folks at your organization or from AES and SEs specifically like Slack channel like how do you both get this information for your programs so we you know again yo...","quite honestly from our perspective you&#x27;ve got to be open to receiving field intel from any channels yep absolutely it doesn&#x27;t matter if it&#x27;s you know a direct email to me or the distra list or we I do every now and then I go into crayon I do see something that it got uploaded so you just kind of have to reinforce all of the avenues that your your field can share information if you don&#x27;t just let them know that you&#x27;re monitoring it that that&#x27;s a gift right so definitely accept it regardless of w...","giving kudos right of one of the most powerful things that we we&#x27;ve done and it&#x27;s again it hasn&#x27;t created a tsunami right of insights or field intelligence is when we do get a pricing sheet right or an RFV quote or something like that we share it with the places that you know people care about competitive and we say so and so purchase it and then folks kind of oh well in my inbox I got probably four or five of these right I can forward them along like reinforcing that behavior in multiple differ...","four five one um forced for research very positively viewed at least in my organization it&#x27;s um third party it&#x27;s reputable obviously we use a lot of um that kind of research to reinforce our positioning because not us saying that we&#x27;re great it&#x27;s a you know in an independent um kind of uh research group verifying that um so that&#x27;s actually one of the the mandates of for for my team from from my leader which is to bring more of that market perspective in because we are insular we talk about ourse...","a proof point that validates the positioning here point maybe um and so you know if we&#x27;re talking about like a Gartner Magic Quadrant for example just give me a quadrant I definitely don&#x27;t want the report um but I want you know I want the quadrant where we&#x27;re in the upper right um and you know and and you know to me me&#x27;s point to the um you know whether it&#x27;s the product organization or product marketing or marketing or you know some other part of the business will be much more interested in goin...","requests and folks have to yes or no and then a subsequent question was do you trust the insights that you get from your CI point person or team um and every single stakeholder who said they do get ad hoc support said yes I trust the insights I get from my CI team and as you can see the stakeholders who do not get that ad hoc support well just over half of them said that they trust the insights they get from their CI team so this seems to suggest that one of the keys to earning the trust of your...","know project you know really significant projects there&#x27;s a lot of recurring work that you&#x27;ve got to have capacity for if you&#x27;re doing win loss that&#x27;s that&#x27;s burning up a lot of cycles on a monthly or a quarterly basis that&#x27;s not available for these sorts of projects the two main things i&#x27;m you know pieces of advice i would offer for for a CI team that&#x27;s trying to figure out how we can best support ad hoc um requests the first thing i would say is recognize the requests as a general statement of...","those competitive intelligence solicitation skills back on our stakeholders to understand what it is what they really need because the the original statement is is a once that hides the need and it&#x27;s your job to kind of find the need um so that&#x27;s that&#x27;s the first thing and the second thing i would say is um to always remember that you have superpowers um that the ad hoc request that once you&#x27;ve identified the need is something you will be able to address in you know two to four hours and maybe y...","of feel like you know every every request that you know i i have to do exactly what they asked me to do and if it&#x27;s like a 20 week engagement you know that that occupies all my time well i guess that&#x27;s what i guess that&#x27;s my life now basically and to say well you could probably do a lot for them if you took time to understand the need and time box a certain amount of time and you know recognize your own superpower within that small amount of time much more than you might think you can do thank y...","request if you if folks on the call are trying to understand or figure out how to balance all of the requests that come to the organization the way that we&#x27;ve done it is through kind of tearing of requests so you can imagine we have a lot of reps we have a lot of products we have a lot of competitors and we just can&#x27;t address them all so we push folks to a form where we the questions we typically ask over and over again we put that in there to get them to give us that detail in advance and we al...","give the validation why but that&#x27;s the ad hoc sales side which is always part of the CI programs kind of remit you have to help sales but this is the way that we organize it there&#x27;s another component of ad hoc request that we discuss which is the strategic stuff that comes from leadership from product teams and those are the ones we want to grab on to because at least for Akamai we started with winning over the sales team making sure that they were satisfied so that we could take that good will ...","business I think absolutely concur I&#x27;m sorry Connor I know I don&#x27;t want to say absolutely concur with you know with Mimi&#x27;s perspective on particularly those more strategic ad hoc requests and I might have been polite and diplomatic but the language in my mind around those requests is very I heard you I yeah I feel heard and I feel seen thank you I think I think you&#x27;re point about the tearing mean you&#x27;re having a system for tearing is super impressive and that should definitely be everyone on

sake of time I am gonna I&#x27;m gonna ask me hold off on audience questions until we get through the the next slide but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m hearing is that earlier we talk about how how sometimes CI folks need to act like marketers right in in over communicating and getting out the value of CI what I heard both of you s...","do that discovery with your with your stakeholders yeah kind of I know we&#x27;re you know just real quick I&#x27;m thrilled that you use the word discovery because you know we we actually recently translated our project charter to a discovery document and what what we found is and we reoriented the throng sales language that stakeholders that were coming with ad hoc requests were much more interested in engaging with us because then they understood it in the context of their day to day job or in terms of...","16% of CI leaders said yes and this year 36% of CI leaders said yes that is a 125% increase you know since 2018 so folks are getting better and better at measuring the impact of competitive intelligence so maybe we&#x27;ll we&#x27;ll start with you if that&#x27;s okay I&#x27;m curious for folks on the phone who do not have KPIs for their CI program any advice you have for those folks to to get started yeah I&#x27;m start simple and our our KPIs frankly are very very simple too at least we&#x27;re about two years into the jou...","part of my team&#x27;s objectives that goes all the way up to the CMO another is winning more more competitive deals I think that&#x27;s pretty self explanatory it can be difficult depending on your systems to actually measure win rates but I think we&#x27;re using more of a qualitative like are we doing a good job are we getting good feedback versus pure measurements I think once we get to a point where we can actually get those numbers that would be great we&#x27;re just not there yet and then it&#x27;s about expandin...","that we&#x27;ve tried to follow is to align our KPIs with basically input to the KPIs against which our stakeholders are going to be measured so so things like win rates which are difficult to get win rates against particular competitors we know for a fact
